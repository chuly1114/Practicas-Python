#Comparison operators
# a == b: a is equal to b

# a != b: a is different than b

# a < b: a is smaller than b

# a <= b: a is smaller or equal to b

# a > b: a is bigger than b

# a >= b: a is bigger or equal to b

# Logical operators
# a and b: True if both a and b are True. False otherwise.

# a or b: True if either a or b or both are True. False if both are False.

# # not a: True if a is False, False if a is True.
